Abstract
This project implements a multi-client chat application using TCP and multithreading in C, allowing clients to communicate through a centralized server. 
Each client is assigned a unique ID and can send messages to specific recipients, with the server ensuring accurate delivery and acknowledgment. 
Synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores, manage concurrent communication and prevent race conditions.  
The project emphasizes user-friendly interaction with real-time message delivery, error handling, and clean termination processes. 
It integrates networking, multithreading, and synchronization concepts, offering a scalable solution for peer-to-peer communication systems.
